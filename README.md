How the trending topics of US Films have changed since 1950 from IMDb datasets 

We plan to get a US movie dataset of size 72,000 from IMDb by scraping. If the dataset is too cluttered, we plan to do get a certain percentage of the top movies in each decade. Our goal is to find the most popular genres of different decades by analyzing the movie descriptions as well as reviews and box office results. 

We plan to define “popular” in three senses:
The proportion of a topic among the movie produced.
The box office gross.
The ratings from audience.
We plan to make further analysis after we collect the above results.
Run regression to see if there are other variables that affect the popularity of topic. (eg. GDP, Engel's Coefficient）
Run sentiment analysis on the reviews of popular/unpopular movies to see what was most loved/hated by the audiences. 
Look at the years when there’s major breakthroughs in movie industry and how that relate to the changes in the popularity of certain topic. (eg. the advent of digital films, special effects technology breakthrough.)
Analyze some “interesting” cases (eg. movies with good box office but poor ratings)
